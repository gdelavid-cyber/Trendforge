/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/core.js : THE CORE RECIPE CATALOG — the 10 foundational use cases.

   This is DATA, not logic. recipes.js consumes the aggregate (recipe-catalog/index.js) and owns all the
   normalization / freezing / launch primitives. Splitting the catalog out of recipes.js means content scales
   (R4: ~50 use cases across personas) without ever touching the launch logic — a persona file (dev.js /
   research.js / creator.js / ops.js) is a sibling of this one, registered in index.js with a one-line add.

   ══ THE RECIPE BAR (2026-08 STANDING-AUTOMATION overhaul — every built-in must clear ALL SIX) ══
     1. THE CHAT-BOX TEST — ⛔ THE GATE THAT DECIDES EVERYTHING. Paste this directive into a plain chat box
                         with no tools. If the answer is roughly as good, THE RECIPE DOES NOT SHIP. A recipe
                         must NEED this station: its live tools, its durable memory, or its cadence. "Plan a
                         trip", "draft a reply", "give me gift ideas" all fail — they are prompts wearing a
                         card, and a catalog full of them makes the whole feature look like a prompt list.
     2. DRIVES THE STATION — it reads or writes something REAL: the web (dish), files (cabinet), terminal
                         (workbench), memory (notebook), connected channels (connector). A paste-box is a
                         fallback the directive offers, never the primary input.
     3. COMPOUNDS      — it reads its OWN previous run out of memory and reports the DELTA. The Nth run must
                         beat the first. A recipe that returns the same answer every time is a one-shot, and
                         a one-shot had better be clearing bar 1 on tools alone.
     4. LANDS SOMEWHERE — a file, a scheduled routine, a drafted message on a real channel, or a ranked
                         decision. Never "here is some text" in the transcript.
     5. EARNS ITS TAP  — the directive encodes METHOD and JUDGMENT (steps, quality criteria, output shape,
                         the failure mode to avoid) the Commander would never bother typing.
     6. NON-OBVIOUS **or** UNIVERSAL — ⛔ THE CONTENT TEST, and the reason this catalog exists at all. A
                         recipe ships only if it is EITHER something the Commander would never have thought
                         to ask an agent for and immediately wants once they see it ("scan my sent messages
                         for promises I made and never closed"), OR something of real value to essentially
                         every StarNet user ("tell me what changed in the terms of the services I pay for").
                         A recipe that is merely a competent version of an obvious request fails this — the
                         obvious request is what the chat box is for. THE CATALOG'S JOB IS TO SHOW SOMEONE A
                         USE CASE THEY COULD NOT HAVE NAMED THEMSELVES.

   Aim the content at who ACTUALLY runs this station — people building software, shipping content, and
   running small operations — but reach for the use case that generalizes, not the one narrowed to one job.

   The scout's auto-mint directive (sidecar/scout.js buildRecipeDirective) enforces the same bar, so
   personalized recipes the station drafts for its Commander never regress below the curated catalog.

   Schema v2 (each record; recipes.js fills sensible defaults for anything omitted):
     id, name, emoji, tagline, blurb, accent   — identity + card language
     tags: { code|research|general -> weight }  — interest-lane weights the recommender ranks by
     params: [{ key, label, placeholder, required, default }]   — the launch form
     task: '<directive template with {tokens}>' — the imperative directive the agent runs
     gear: [objectType]        — station objects this use case DRAWS ON (advisory only; same vocab as skills
                                 `requires`: dish/cabinet/notebook/workbench/studio/computer/connector). NEVER gates.
     skills: [slug]            — optional bundled-skill references ("pairs with feed-watch")
     cadence: 'morning'|'weekly'|'sixhourly'|'hourly'|null   — a SUGGESTED cadence for naturally-recurring use
                                 cases (null = one-shot by nature). The MAKE-ROUTINE picker defaults to this.
     category: string          — a browse bucket ('research'|'code'|'writing'|'planning'|'general')

   UMD-light: a `RecipeCatalogCore` global in the browser; module.exports (the raw array) under node. */
'use strict';
(function (root, factory) {
  const api = factory();
  if (typeof module !== 'undefined' && module.exports) module.exports = api;
  else { root.RecipeCatalogCore = api; }
})(typeof globalThis !== 'undefined' ? globalThis : this, function () {
  'use strict';

  /* Every `task` is written as an imperative DIRECTIVE (so Classify.isTaskDirective fires and the agent DOES the
     work instead of just chatting), in the harness voice, leading with the bottom-line ask. {tokens} are
     substituted from the param form at launch. `gear` names the capabilities the use case naturally leans on
     (a research brief wants the WEB → dish; a code review wants FILES → cabinet). It is ADVISORY: a WANT badge +
     quest hook, never a lock. `cadence` is a SUGGESTION — only set on use cases that read as naturally recurring.
     TAG HONESTY: a recipe's tags must include the lane Classify.getTag assigns its filled directive (locked by
     test/recipes.test.js) — keep the lane vocabulary in mind when editing task text. */

That step is the whole point: an edit made to a generic standard returns competent anonymous prose, which is worse than my own rough draft. Then cut filler, hedges and throat-clearing; favour concrete verbs; keep every load-bearing idea. Leave alone anything merely unusual but working — that is voice, and editing it out is how writing becomes uniform. If a sentence must change meaning to get shorter, flag it rather than silently changing it. Return the tightened version first, then every change as before-and-after with a one-line reason, then the word count before and after.

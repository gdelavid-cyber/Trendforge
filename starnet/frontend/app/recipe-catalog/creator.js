/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/creator.js : CREATOR recipes — audience, publishing, and the archive.

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light module
   pattern as recipes.js: a `RecipeCatalogCreator` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO logic here — pure data.

   ══ WHY THIS MODULE WAS REBUILT (2026-08-04) ══
   Seven of its ten recipes failed the chat-box test outright: "draft me some hooks", "give me title
   ideas", "outline a script". A plain chat box does all of that just as well, so shipping them is what
   made the catalog read as a prompt list. The rebuild rests on the one thing a chat box does not have:
   THE COMMANDER'S OWN ARCHIVE AND CHANNELS. Every recipe here reads what they actually published, what
   their audience actually said, or what the live web now says about work they put out months ago.

   That reframing is also what makes these NON-OBVIOUS (bar 6). "Write me a hook" is a request anyone
   thinks of. "Go through everything I have published and tell me which claims have since become false"
   is not — and it is only possible on a station that can read the archive and the live web together.

   Content contract: every record clears THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js, all six points.

/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/money.js : MONEY persona recipes — the money admin a person actually has.

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light module
   pattern as its siblings: a `RecipeCatalogMoney` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record clears THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap / drives
   the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring), in the same imperative harness voice.

   ══ THE MONEY LINE (this module's extra bar — do not cross it) ══
   These recipes do money ADMIN — sorting what was spent, assembling what an accountant needs, doing the
   arithmetic on a payoff order, finding a charge you stopped noticing. They never recommend a security to
   buy or sell, never size a position, and never tell the Commander what to do with savings. Where a
   directive touches investing at all it GATHERS AND EXPLAINS, and says plainly that the call is the
   Commander's and a licensed advisor's — that is not a disclaimer bolted on, it is what the recipe does.
   A recipe that would only be useful as advice does not ship here.

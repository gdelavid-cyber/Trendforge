/* STARNET — spacebg.js : THE BACKDROP. What the station floats in.

   One shared backdrop for the live world (world.js) AND REFIT (build.js), so entering/exiting
   build mode never jumps the sky. Originally a single hardcoded deep-space field; now a small
   REGISTRY of backdrops the commander picks (station-wide, persisted in the StationUI store).

   THE LAW OF THIS FILE, in order of importance:

   1. THE VOID IS THE DEFAULT. It was frozen byte-identical from 2026-07-14 until 2026-09-05, when
      Andrew asked for it to be improved in place (structured nebulas, stepped twinkle, sparkle).
      Its CHARACTER is still the law: sparse cold points on real black, faint distant gas, no
      parallax, the same drift. Never decorate it with bodies.
      On 2026-07-14 a galaxy + ringed planet were added to it and Andrew had them reverted
      (514386de: "keep the sky to starfield + nebulas + band + meteor"). That call stands.
      Richer space lives in THE NURSERY, which is opt-in. Never decorate the default.
      Corollary, learned the hard way on 2026-07-24: a NEW backdrop must not be the default
      plus decoration either. The first attempt at richer space reused this file's own
      nebula/dust/twinkle recipe and added bodies on top, and read exactly as what it was —
      "just the void with planets". A backdrop earns its place by INVERTING the default's
      signature, not by extending it.
   2. A BACKDROP IS NOT A WALLPAPER. Anything at a finite distance below the station MUST
      parallax with the camera, or the eye reads "picture behind a picture" instantly. Deep
      space is the one honest exception — it has no near reference, so THE VOID's depths are
      0/0 and it stays nailed to the screen exactly as before.
   3. THE CAMERA NEVER TILTS. Every backdrop is a thing seen from directly above, at altitude.
      No horizon, no sun in frame, no "up". The station floats; you look past it, straight down.

   Structure:
     - shared helpers: seeded PRNG, star tints, wrapped puff stamps, toroidal tile draw
     - shared weather: the rare meteor and the very rare bolide (space backdrops opt in)
     - BACKDROPS registry: each { label, build(w,h,rnd) -> state, draw(ctx,w,h,now,cam,st) }
     - dispatch: variant-aware tile cache, resize settling, public API

   Coordinates are DEVICE pixels (callers pass canvas.width/height) and draw() is called with
   the IDENTITY transform, before the world's setTransform(scale,0,0,scale,panX,panY). The
   camera is handed in separately so each backdrop can parallax by its own per-layer depth.

   Everything is seeded (mulberry32, fixed seed per backdrop) so the same backdrop at the same
   canvas size always grows the same world — a resize re-lays it deterministically instead of
   reshuffling. Pre-rendered tiles wrap: THE VOID wraps horizontally only (3-stamp, its layers
   never move in y); every backdrop that parallaxes vertically wraps in BOTH axes (9-stamp
   author + 2x2 draw), or a vertical pan tears the tile seam straight across the screen.

   Tuning note inherited from the original field: everything here is judged AFTER the barrel
   warp + CRT pass in world.js, which eats roughly half the contrast. Values look too bold in
   isolation on purpose. Never tune a backdrop on a bare canvas. */

  /* --------------------------------------------------------- BACKDROP: THE NURSERY ---- */
  /* A star factory. REBUILT 2026-09-09 (Andrew: "the nursery ... need significantly way better
     looking"). The version this replaces obeyed every rule below and was still nearly invisible
     on a live station: the gas topped out at [125,38,69] behind a CRT pass that halves contrast,
     the cloud's centroid was pinned to the frame centre — i.e. BEHIND THE STATION — and nothing
     in the field ever twinkled.

     The lessons that still bind (every one learned the hard way on this backdrop):
       - CAMO is quantized organic noise at one mid-tone (v2: "purple camo if anything"). The
         frame needs real black around the cloud and real structure inside it.
       - SMUDGY is a per-pixel gradient. Dither between hard ramp steps; never blend.
       - A BAYER MATRIX IS A WINDOW SCREEN over soft gas (2026-07-25): the dither is a hash.
       - GAS IS ALLOWED TO BE BRIGHT, NEVER TO CLIP. The ramp tops at pale peach; white belongs
         only to points of light (stars, knots). A wide bright patch striped by scanlines is the
         failure this rule exists for.
       - NO ALPHA FLOOR: thin gas is nothing, not a veil. The starfield gets its black back.
       - STARS FIRST, full resolution, and the gas composites OVER them with per-pixel alpha, so
         thin gas lets them through and dense gas and dust occlude them. That is the depth cue.
       - The station stays the brightest thing on screen (post-CRT backdrop/station luma ~0.5-0.7).

     What is NEW, in order of how much it buys:
       1. THE COMPLEX IS A BAND. The cloud runs as a wrapped diagonal across a 2:1 fixed tile
          (it descends exactly one tile-height per tile-width, so it is continuous on the torus),
          lumped and gapped by noise so it is a chain of clouds rather than a stripe. Any window
          onto the tile is crossed by it, and draw() pins its centreline through the upper third
          of the frame — beside the station, never under it. There is nothing left to lose off
          screen; the sway only keeps it breathing.
       2. TWO GAS SPECIES. H-alpha (violet -> magenta -> pink -> peach) carries the mass; O-III
          (deep teal -> cyan) has its OWN density field and shows where the hydrogen is thin, so
          the colour contrast is a second cloud, not a tint on the first.
       3. FILAMENTS. A ridged octave (1 - |2n - 1|) folded into the density draws thin bright
          threads through the mass — what makes emission nebulae look combed instead of blobbed.
       4. IONIZATION FRONTS. Gas near a young cluster is pushed toward gold, and every dust lane
          carries a warm reflected brim instead of a black edge. Colour now says where the heat is.
       5. YOUNG CLUSTERS. Where the gas is densest: tight knots of white/blue points inside a
          local glow, plus amber protostars buried in the dust. The top of the value range, and a
          place for the eye to land.
       6. A LIVE FIELD. Near stars step between three brightness levels and a few big round ones
          pulse — the pixel-honest twinkle ANDROMEDA got and Andrew liked. Foreground motes drift.
     Nothing is smooth-shaded: gas is quantized to LEVELS bands under a hash dither, stars are
     hard pixels, and the only radial gradients are glows sitting under hard points. */

  /* ------------------------------------------------------------ BACKDROP: ANDROMEDA ---- */
  /* Built to a REFERENCE Andrew supplied on 2026-09-04 after rejecting two guesses (a face-on
     black-hole disc: "i hate it"; the void sharpened: "just looks like our original but worse").
     The reference: a hard-quantized pixel-art galaxy — pure black, then FOUR blues (navy, blue,
     cyan, white) and nothing else; chunky 2-4px cells; a tilted spiral with a blown-white core
     falling off through cyan and blue to scattered single navy pixels; a dense dust of tiny blue
     stars everywhere; a few big ROUND white stars. His words: "something like this but animated,
     should have space travel actively moving in the background, stars that actually twinkle, and
     a galaxy or maybe even black hole."

     So, the three things the reference does not do on its own and this must:
       1. TRAVEL. The star layers STREAM, continuously and visibly (the void's drift is 3-15 px/s
          and reads as still; this runs 5-30 px/s diagonally, far slow / near fast) and the
          galaxy, being the farthest thing, barely moves at all. That speed ladder IS the travel.
       2. TWINKLE that reads as pixels: the near stars step between three brightness levels

     make it more like a meteor shower vibe and give it the orange red hue" — and "i love it" on
     the result. SHARPENED 2026-09-09 ("need significantly way better looking") without changing
     what it is: the same red family, the same small rocks in parallax layers, the same ember
     swarm and fireball. What changed is the RENDERING of every layer:
       - ROCKS have real form: a five-tone terminator (shadow side, body, half-light, lit rim, hot
         rim) from a spherical normal instead of one flat body with a rim, craters with a LIT FAR
         WALL and a dark bowl, and two materials (maroon and a greyer basalt) instead of one.
         ⛔ SMALL ROCKS ONLY (Andrew, 2026-09-09: "without the thick rocks, should just be the
         smaller asteroids"). A first sharpening added a 24-34px hero layer and a tumbling 30px
         asteroid event; both were cut the same day. Nothing here is wider than ~11px now, and the
         size ladder is grains -> pebbles -> stones, never boulders. More of them, not bigger.
       - A DUST NEBULA at the very back: dim red and purple wisps, hash-dithered, so the black has
         depth and the shower has an atmosphere to fly through. Faint by design — the rocks are
         the subject, and this is not a new one.
       - EMBERS carry a hot head halo; the FIREBALL wears a glowing head and sheds live sparks.
     Reduced motion still empties the swarm and skips the fireball.
     Rocks occlude the stars; that occlusion is what makes them solid. */

     puff gradient IS. A cloud seen from above is an OBJECT: a lobed cumulus mass with a hard
     outline, a lit rim on the sun side, a shaded rim on the far side and a flat body between.
     Built from overlapping discs into a coverage field, edged by a hash dither (so the outline is
     ragged at the pixel scale, never anti-aliased), and shaded in THREE flat tones by probing the

  /* --------------------------------------------------------------- BACKDROP: OCEAN ---- */
  /* Open water from altitude. REBUILT 2026-09-09 on the bones of the 07-24 rewrite.

     THE MISTAKE THAT REWRITE FIXED still binds (Andrew: "it looks like stars"): water is a
     CONTINUOUS SURFACE, never sparse bright marks on a dark field. Every pixel is water, waves
     are a modulation of it, foam sits on crests, and glitter is DENSE and lies on a BRIGHT sheen —
     the properties a starfield can never have. The sun is never in frame (law 3).

     What that rewrite got wrong, measured live: everything was SOFT. The sea ran from [3,13,23]
     to [22,45,53] — a 30-unit range that a CRT pass halves to nothing — its clouds were 18% radial
     puffs, and the whole frame read as a dark blue smudge with paler smudges on it. A surface
     seen from altitude is not soft. It is the hardest-edged thing in nature.

     What is different now:
       1. A WIDE, HARD SEA RAMP. Seven flat steps from navy to teal-grey, hash-dithered at the band
          edges so no contour ring is ever drawn, and two ramps (deep vs shallow water) chosen by a
          slow noise so the sea has broad colour structure as well as waves.
       2. CREST LINES. Wherever a band steps up toward the sun, the pixel on the lit side is drawn
          in a single bright crest tone — the 1px highlight line that IS pixel-art water, in every
          game that ever drew a sea. The line follows the wave field, so it is never a pattern.
       3. THE WATER MOVES. Four plates, the fine texture wave advanced a quarter cycle in each,
          stepped every FRAME_MS: the classic stepped ripple loop, exact on the torus because the
          wave is an integer number of cycles across the tile. Reduced motion holds plate 0.
       4. A REAL SHEEN. The sun's answer is a visible bright patch now, and the glitter in it is
          twice as dense and bright — still dashes, still only inside the sheen.
       5. PIXEL CLOUDS. Hard-edged cumulus with a lit rim, a shaded rim and a HARD SHADOW on the
          water from the same shapes, offset down-sun. The shadow rides the deck depth and the
          cloud rides the cloud depth, so panning pulls them apart — that gap is the altitude.
     The LIGHT block is still scaled AS A SET: the station stays the brightest thing on screen. */

  /* ---------------------------------------------------------- BACKDROP: NIGHT CITY ---- */
  /* A city at night from altitude. REBUILT 2026-09-09 — the first cut had the right idea (an
     axis-aligned lattice of sodium lamps, districts, a river the grid bends around, an orange
     dome) at a tenth of the light: measured live, its lamps sat at 6-40% alpha under a 13% warm
     veil and a CRT pass that halves contrast, so what reached the screen was a faint brown grid
     that read as a texture, not a place. Nobody could see the city.

     What a city looks like from straight above at night, and what this now draws:
       - STREETS ARE LINES OF LAMPS. Bright, regular, continuous — the lattice is the subject.
         Arterials are wider and hotter and BRIDGE the river; side streets stop at the water.
       - BLOCKS ARE BUILDINGS. The grid encloses blocks, and a block is lit by what stands on it:
         downtown blocks carry towers — footprints packed with cool white windows on a 2px
         lattice — dense districts line their streets with warm windows, suburbs scatter a few
         porch lights, parks stay dark. District comes from ONE density field, so downtown,
         suburb and park all fall out of the same map instead of three systems.
       - THE RIVER IS DARK, and it answers the city back: embankment lamps along both banks and
         the bank lights smeared into the water beneath them.
       - THE DOME. Light pollution over the dense parts, additive, breathing slightly.
       - LIVE: traffic runs the arterials as 2px dashes (warm one way, red the other), and a
         dozen red beacons on the tallest towers blink out of phase. Reduced motion holds the
         beacons steady and the cars still.
       - CLOUDS are hard-edged pixel cumulus, UNDERLIT: dark body, every thin edge glowing the
         city's orange. That the light is BELOW the cloud is the strongest altitude cue there is.
     Roads stay axis-aligned on purpose — that is what most cities look like from directly above
     AND the only thing that tiles seamlessly on a torus; the river gets the sine treatment.
     Every mark on the ground plate is a hard pixel written into one wrapped buffer, so a lamp is
     a lamp and not a smear, and the tile seams by construction. */

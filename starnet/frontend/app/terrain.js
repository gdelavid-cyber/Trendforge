/* STARNET — terrain.js : THE GROUND. What the station is standing ON.

   THIS IS NOT A BACKDROP, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE POINT.

   spacebg.js draws things at a DISTANCE, in screen space, deliberately not zooming — correct for
   a starfield or a sea a long way below. Terrain is at the SAME PLANE as the station: it must pan
   AND zoom with it, or the illusion dies on the first scroll-wheel tick. The camera zooms 0.5x to
   6x (world.js MINZ/MAXZ), a 12x range, so faking that in screen space would fall apart violently.

   So the ground is drawn in WORLD space, between world.js's setTransform() and the station bake.
   At that seam the camera transform is already applied, which means panning, zooming and the
   station's own coordinate frame all come for free — no parallax maths, no toroidal wrap, no
   camera plumbing.

   THREE layers, because they fail differently:
     1. THE PATCH — soil, moss, litter. Fine texture, tiled with createPattern (ONE fillRect, not
        hundreds of drawImage). Fine texture can repeat every few hundred pixels invisibly.
     2. THE FIELD — a world-space value noise that decides how much grows WHERE. This is what the
        first forest lacked: it scattered trees at a flat 38% everywhere, so the eye read an even
        stipple with no groves, no glades and no edges. Density variation is structure, and
        structure is most of what "detailed" actually means.
     3. THE SCATTER — trees, logs, ferns, boulders. These CANNOT tile: a repeating tree is
        instantly legible as wallpaper. They are placed by hashing world cell coordinates, which
        gives an infinite non-repeating field with no stored map, drawn from pre-rendered sprites
        so a crown costs one drawImage rather than four hundred stamps every frame.

   The station stands in a CLEARING: scatter is suppressed inside the station's world rect plus a
   margin, and thickened just outside it, because a real clearing has a dense edge.

   WHY THE FIRST FOREST WAS SCRAPPED (2026-07-24, Andrew: "too blurry… just looks like an outline
   of a forest") and what is different here:
     - Crowns were 8 overlapping anti-aliased arcs. A blob with a lit rim IS an outline. Crowns are
       now built from hundreds of hard 1-3px LEAF STAMPS lit by a dome+sun term, with holes punched
       through them, so the mass has interior texture and the ground shows through it.
     - One species. There are now five silhouettes (broadleaf, conifer, birch, snag, sapling) and a
       conifer does not read as a maple from any distance.
     - No layering. Items are y-sorted and overlap, which is the only cue that says "canopy" rather
       than "stickers".
     - Flat lighting. A tiled DAPPLE pass now puts sun through the canopy onto the floor, so the
       floor has large-scale light structure instead of uniform noise. */

  /* FOREST v5 — the DETAIL pass on v4 (Andrew, 2026-09-10, on v4: "no trees and the wilderness need
     more detail it can be definitely wayyyy more detailed"). The key stays: dark, mysterious,
     realistic, an aerial map of old growth (v4's brief: "dark, mysterious gorgeous forest vibe,
     like ur looking down from a map of a forest. Realistic" — after v3's flat-tone crowns, lit
     grass and flowers were rejected as "a cartoon world").

     THE FORESTS BEFORE IT, and what each taught:
       v1 (07-24): anti-aliased arcs — "too blurry... an outline of a forest". Edges must be hard.
       v2 (07-24 → 09-09): hard leaf stamps over dark duff. Right key; at play zoom, 2x2 confetti.
       v3 (09-09): flat four-tone crowns on lit grass — legible, and a cartoon.
       v4 (09-10): dome-shaded crowns through dithered satellite-green ramps, black gaps, dark
           floor, black water. Right key and right read — and every crown was one smooth dome,
           the floor bare, the undergrowth thin. Detail is where realism actually lives.

     WHAT DETAIL MEANS HERE (all of it hard pixels, all of it dark-keyed):
       1. A CROWN IS CLUSTERS OF CLUSTERS. Two levels of sub-domes — big lobes and small lobelets —
          each with its own lit side, so a crown is a cauliflower of leaf masses, not a ball. Where
          two big lobes meet there is a dark SEAM (the branch gap between them), and on the sun side
          of the lobelets the top ramp step sparkles: individual lit leaf clusters. The outline is
          roughened by a fine noise so no crown edge is ever a clean curve.
       2. CONIFERS SHOW THEIR WHORLS. A spruce from above is a wheel of branches: the sawtooth
          outline now carries the same rhythm INSIDE — ridges lit, valleys dark — round a bright apex.
       3. THE WILDERNESS IS THICK. Undergrowth density is doubled and varied — ferns, dark bushes,
          saplings, fallen branches, mossed logs, stumps, boulders, mushroom clusters — and it now
          grows in the station's clearing margin too (never under the floor plan), because play
          zoom looks at exactly that ground.
       4. THE FLOOR IS A FLOOR. Leaf litter with shape, pine-needle drifts, small plants, moss with
          texture, roots, twigs, stones, puddles in the wet — under a dark key, in a narrow range.
       5. THE RIVER HAS BANKS: gravel, rocks breaking the surface, a faint sheen.
     Scale reference (measured, unchanged): an agent body is ~35 world px, ONE WORLD PIXEL ≈ 5cm. */

  /* A landed station on a mare plain. The forest's problem was making an organic mass legible;
     the moon's is the opposite — there is exactly ONE material out here, so every scrap of
     interest has to come from FORM. Which is lucky, because form is what a crater is.

     THREE THINGS CARRY IT:
       1. THE SUN IS LOW AND THERE IS NO AIR. Shadows are long, hard and BLACK — no atmospheric
          fill light, no colour bounce, no falloff. That single fact is most of the drama, and it
          is why the shadow colour here is nearly (0,0,0) while the forest's is a dark green.
       2. CRATERS ARE HOLES, NOT DOMES, and the difference is which side is lit. In a bowl the FAR
          wall (down-sun) catches the light and the near wall is in shadow — precisely inverted
          from a boulder. Get that backwards and the whole plain inflates into bubble wrap; it is
          the classic failure of every procedural moon.
       3. SCALE HIERARCHY. Real regolith is craters inside craters inside craters, over five
          orders of magnitude. Three placement grids (basins, craters, pits) plus micro-pits baked
          into the tiling patch is enough to fake that, and it is what keeps the plain from reading
          as a texture with dots on it. */

         the OUTER slope faces the sun (bright) while the INNER slope faces away (dark); on the
         down-sun side both are exactly reversed. So the two bands are lit by the same term with

         side — at two radii 14% apart, which at any real zoom is the same circle. The sum of two
         correct half-rings was one wrong full ring, and the plain came out as pegboard.

         parallel to the sun show nothing at all. So the band's WIDTH tapers with the same term that

       A plain of nothing but craters reads as a texture with dots on it: every feature is the same
       size and roughly round, so there is no composition at any scale bigger than one crater. Real
       mare basalt is crossed by wrinkle ridges — long, low, sinuous swells, hundreds of px of gentle
       rise, and under a low sun they are the most legible thing out there.

       BUILT AS CHAINABLE SEGMENTS, not drawn per frame. Stamping a ridge pixel by pixel in world
       space would be twenty thousand fillRects a frame; instead each segment sprite carries its
       crest through the vertical CENTRE at both its left and right edges, so any two segments in
       any order join seamlessly and a lane of them is one continuous ridge for the cost of four
       drawImage calls. */

         The first cut gave every segment the same crest height at both edges, which chains
         perfectly — and produces a dead-horizontal ridge running the full width of the world.
         Two of those across a frame read as seams, not landforms. Instead each segment declares a
         START level and an END level from {-1,0,+1}; the placer picks the level per column with a
         hash, so segment N's end always matches segment N+1's start and the lane wanders diagonally
         with no discontinuity anywhere. Wang tiles, essentially, in one dimension. */

     the station won't deliver.

     BUILT AT A REFERENCE SIZE AND SCALED DOWN, which is the same law the sky swatches learned:
     drawing straight into a 112x63 chip shows one third of one tree crown, because the features
     are sized in WORLD px and the chip is a tiny window onto the world — not a small picture of
     it. Rendering a proper 4x view and shrinking it shows the place instead of a close-up of its
     dirt.

     MEMOISED, because a sample costs a whole ground BUILD. `st = null` below forces build(id) to
     regenerate the patch, the overlay and every sprite pool before it can draw one chip — measured
     live on a seeded station at 112x63: moon 400ms, forest 150ms, and SETTINGS repainted all six
     swatches on EVERY build of the panel (open, tab swap, any rerender). The inputs are fully
     deterministic (fixed seed 0x0FE57, no camera, no clock, no theme), so the cached chip is
     bit-identical to a fresh render — this caches the REAL renderer's output, it does not stand in

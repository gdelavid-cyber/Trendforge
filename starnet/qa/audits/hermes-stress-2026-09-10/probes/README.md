# Probe archive

These are copies of the audit probes with normalized LF line endings, not product code or registered tests.
They use synthetic inputs and local services. Preserve the directory layout when rerunning:

1. Use an isolated StarNet worktree at the recorded commit and install its dependencies.
2. Copy the .cjs files to a root `.audit/` directory.
3. Clone official Hermes tag `v2026.9.7` into `.audit/hermes`; copy the .py files there.
4. Use a Python environment with Hermes dependencies plus pytest, pytest-asyncio and jsonschema. Set `HERMES_HOME` to a new audit-only directory before Python imports; never use the real profile.
5. Run `node .audit/schema.cjs` and `node .audit/partial.cjs` from the StarNet root.
6. Run `node .audit/live-seeded.cjs` for the UI/JSON-format fixture. This stays running. The generated `.audit/live.json` identifies its URL and seed process.
7. With that server running, run `node .audit/idempotency.cjs`. Count primary requests by exact last user message in `.audit/requests.json`, not the total request delta: auxiliary skill review adds requests. The raw idempotency probe intentionally preserves the original total delta; the receipt corrects the denominator.
8. From `.audit/hermes`, run `probe_audit.py`, `probe_http.py`, and `probe_format.py`. HTTP probes inject agent results into real production routes; they are not live-model evaluations.
9. Inspect the UI normally, then stop only the fixture processes you launched. Run `node .audit/receipt.cjs` after the named evidence logs exist.

The receipt's aggregate test counts describe the original recorded run, not a new run. Update them when changing the selected tests.

Post-implementation schema receipt: after copying the archived probes to the root .audit directory, run node .audit/schema-live.cjs from the worktree root. It starts a controlled local provider and source sidecar, checks all twelve positive/negative constraint cases with exact usage, writes .audit/schema-live.json, and cleans up its fixture. It does not call a paid model.

Browser follow-up: copy browser-stream.cjs and seed-entry.cjs to the root .audit directory. Run node .audit/browser-stream.cjs only after stopping your earlier seeded fixture, since both use the same isolated dev scratch workspace. The browser-live.json file gives the URL. Through COMMS, send STREAM-REPORT-731 followed by a request for the audit report; the local provider emits 60-character chunks each second and appends the six-column artifact table. This mock is for rendering/clipboard checks and returns fixture text to auxiliary calls too. Stop only the processes this fixture owns when finished.

# Reopened conversations send before history is restored and hide late messages

## Symptom

Reopening a conversation can leave newer messages invisible. Sending immediately can ask the model a follow-up without the latest conversation context, even though those messages subsequently appear in the saved thread. This reproduces mechanisms matching the owner's reports; it does not establish the original customers' exact causes.

## Repro

Run `node test/session-reliability.e2e.test.js` in an isolated worktree. The runner boots the real seeded app, opens A with two local turns, delays its transcript response until the initial scroll pin finishes, and supplies two additional durable turns. Reopen A, send a follow-up before another delayed response supplies a changed destination, then inspect the displayed thread and outgoing `/api/run` messages. Inference is simulated at the browser fetch boundary; persistence and sidecar restart are real.

## Evidence

On trunk 8e182efaf, the live runner recorded `delayedVisible:false`, `beforeHistoryReady:1`, `modelContext:false`, `promptLast:true`, `saved:true`. The restored messages survived restart, demonstrating that this instance was a display/admission race rather than a disk deletion. Baseline receipt: `qa/evidence/session-reliability-0919/baseline.json`. Regression anchors: `test/session-continuity.test.js`, `test/session-reliability.e2e.test.js`.

## Verdict

History rendering incorrectly used the short-lived scroll-pin token as its async load owner. Sending did not await restoration. Per-session read ownership now rejects obsolete results, load generation controls rendering, and inference waits for confirmed history. Unavailable history preserves the admitted turn and offers retry without dispatch. Page-local diagnostic events omit conversation content and titles. Full validation is recorded separately; installer and affected-customer recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

Baseline live failure above. After repair, delayed messages render without another switch and the follow-up request includes the recovered destination. Registered coverage includes 48 controlled lifecycle sequences across desktop/website sources and a combined browser journey: delayed restore, send/switch, background delivery during typing, unavailable history, one explicit retry, stream interruption, failed durable write, acknowledged retry, cache loss and process restart. Tests use controlled upstream transport; no paid model or installed native shell is claimed.

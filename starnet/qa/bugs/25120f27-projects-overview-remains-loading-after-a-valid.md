# Projects overview remains loading after a valid nonempty response

## Symptom

Projects stays at loading projects after adding even a tiny folder; Diagnostics records an unhandled page rejection although the trusted-project backend responds.

## Repro

1. Boot an isolated seeded station.
2. Add an existing folder through Projects > ADD.
3. Observe GET /api/projects return a nonempty projects array while the rail stays loading.

## Evidence

Live baseline 882897d52: valid nonempty HTTP response, zero project rows, loading projects text, and ReferenceError: st is not defined in renderProjectsOverview. The same defective expression exists in tag v0.12.3. Local receipts: .dogfood/projects/before.json and after.json. Regression anchor: test/projects-view.test.js.

## Verdict

The overview incorrectly referenced a session-only status variable. Its rejection fallback rendered the same cached rows and threw again. Remove that reference, cache only successfully rendered snapshots, and contain cached-renderer failures. No persistence or permission changes. Installer and affected-customer recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

The baseline live app reproduces the exact symptom and ReferenceError; patched live app lists the same stored root with zero page exceptions. Production-renderer tests cover trusted/revoked rows, stale rows on network failure, terminal recovery text on renderer failures, retry recovery, and a genuinely empty ledger.

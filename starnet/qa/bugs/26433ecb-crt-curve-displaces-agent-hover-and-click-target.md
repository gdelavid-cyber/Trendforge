# CRT curve displaces agent hover and click targets away from center

## Symptom

The agent responds at screen center but hovering or clicking its visible body near the edges misses.

## Repro

Boot node dev/seed.js --keep, set CRT curve .09 / overscan 1.2, zoom out to roughly 1.15, and pan the same agent from center to left/right and opposite corners. Move and click at the curved visible position.

## Evidence

Source anchor: test/world-agent-click.test.js. Live seeded Chromium at port 8962: before repair center returned pointer/agent, left/right/upper-right/lower-left returned default/null. Image displacement was 38-41 backing pixels. After repair all five returned pointer/agent. Local raw receipts: .proof/before.json and .proof/after.json.

## Verdict

Source fixed in f8b60bef0. Live before/after evidence: qa/curve-pointer-0912.md. Installer and owner recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

Live center passed while four edge positions missed before repair; all five passed afterward. Registered test/world-agent-click.test.js passes 40 assertions. Visible in-app browser click opened the correct dossier at the right side of the canvas. See qa/curve-pointer-0912.md.

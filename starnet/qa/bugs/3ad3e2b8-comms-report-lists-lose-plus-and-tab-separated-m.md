# COMMS report lists lose plus and tab-separated markers

## Symptom

COMMS displays plus-prefixed bullets and tab-separated bullet/number markers as plain text. The same report using hyphens and spaces becomes a semantic list.

## Repro

1. Start an isolated app with `node dev/seed.js --keep` and enter COMMS.
2. Render an assistant report containing `+ First` and `+ Second`, each on its own line, through `Chat.renderProse`.
3. Repeat with a tab after a hyphen or a numbered marker.
4. Inspect the visible message body: the affected inputs produce zero list items; `- First` with a space produces two.

## Evidence

On integration source `00de68e0f`, the real seeded browser returned list-item counts 0, 0, 0, 2 for plus, hyphen-tab, number-tab and hyphen-space inputs. After the repair it returned 2, 2, 2, 2. Raw DOM outcomes are recorded in `qa/evidence/0.11.2-merge-audit/report-lists.json`.

`test/chat-code-copy.test.js` now exercises `renderProse`, including its shortcut, across five markers and two spacing variants. Before the repair six assertions failed; after it all 54 passed. The test remains in the normal fast manifest.

## Verdict

Fixed by `cb6c30b4d`; source and seeded-browser repair verified. Final candidate `1826b558a` passed the complete 769-step fast gate. No installed/customer recovery claim.

## Regression

The public renderer shortcut omitted plus markers, while the new report block parser required a literal space. The repaired gate accepts plus, and the parser accepts horizontal whitespace. Copy retains the exact original report bytes. Live and restored assistant messages share this renderer; group messages call the same public method. Text without list markers still uses the existing plain-text path. Installed desktop verification remains outstanding.

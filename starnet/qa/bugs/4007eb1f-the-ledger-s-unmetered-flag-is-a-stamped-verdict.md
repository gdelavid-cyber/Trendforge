# The ledger's `unmetered` flag is a stamped verdict with zero readers — every ledger USD aggregate (/api/budget, day/global caps) counts subscription dollars tha

## Symptom

On a Grok-OAuth / Kimi / ollama-behind-a-proxy station, the same run reads two different amounts depending on which surface you look at: the RUNS recap says "subscription" and /api/insights says $0.00 with spendLabel "subscription / unmetered", while /api/budget's spentToday + lifetime and the budget governor's day/global pools count the full provider-reported figure. Worse, that phantom spend then BLOCKS a later real (BYOK) run with reason 'budget' and a "CAP HIT" HUD note naming money the Commander never spent.

## Repro

Read-only, against the real modules: `makeCostEngine({priceOf:()=>null}).reconcile({prompt_tokens:40000, completion_tokens:2000, cost_in_usd_ticks:4.2e9}, 'grok-4')` → `{usd:0.42, costSource:'provider'}`. Record it: `L.record({runId:'r-grok', agentId:'hero', usd:0.42, tokens:42000, model:'grok-4', unmetered:true})`. Then `L.totalUsd()` = 0.42 and `L.usdForDay(now)` = 0.42 (what /api/budget prints), while `foldInsights([{...unmetered:true, usd:0.42}])` returns `totalUsd: 0` with `spendLabel:'subscription / unmetered'`. With `makeBudget({caps:{day:0.30}, ledger:L})`, a LATER metered run's `check()` returns `{scope:'day', usd:0.42, cap:0.3}` — blocked on money never spent.

## Evidence

`sidecar/ledger.js:79`

**Mechanism (read from the code):** index.js:11292 stamps the flag: `ledger.record({ runId, agentId, turns, usd: finalUsd, tokens, model: finalModel, unmetered: providerUnmetered })`, and ledger.js:60 persists `unmetered: !!e.unmetered`. But every aggregate in ledger.js goes through `function sum(pred) { … t += num(rows[i].usd); }` (line 79) — `pred` is only ever a ts/runId/agentId filter, so totalUsd/usdForDay/usdSince/usdForAgent all include unmetered rows. Grepping consumers, NOTHING reads the flag off a ledger row: budget.js:99-100 (`day: ledger.usdForDay(now) + liveTotal`, `global: ledger.totalUsd() + liveTotal`), index.js:6669-6671 (`spentToday`/`lifetime`/`totalUsd`) and index.js:9402-9406 all sum blind. insights.js:39-42 reads it correctly (`const meteredUsd = unmetered ? 0 : usd`) — but off RUNSTORE rows, not the ledger. So the flag on the ledger is a stamped verdict with zero consumers, and the two aggregates diverge. Reachability: codex is safe (codex.js:441 hardcodes `cost: 0` and priceOf returns null), but grok/kimi use the openai-compatible adapter, which yields provider usage RAW (`if (j.usage) yield { type:'usage', usage: j.usage }`, openai-compatible.js:182), and cost.js:31-33 accepts `usage.cost` or xAI's `usage.cost_in_usd_ticks` as authoritative. The `grok` profile (registry.js:69-84, unmetered:true) hits the IDENTICAL `https://api.x.ai/v1` endpoint as the metered `xai` profile (registry.js:213-230), and cost.js's own header cites docs.x.ai cost-tracking for that field. spend.js:49 then short-circuits (`if (o.unmetered || base !== 0 …) return base;`) so the non-zero base is preserved into the ledger row.

**Existing test coverage:** test/ledger.test.js:37-46 is the only unmetered coverage and it records `usd: 0` for the unmetered row, so the interesting case never runs — the totals block at lines 48-55 uses metered rows only. test/insights.test.js covers the runstore side (which is correct). No test compares a ledger aggregate against an insights aggregate for the same row.

**Adversarial verdict (survived refutation):** Structurally confirmed. sidecar/ledger.js:79 `function sum(pred) { … t += num(rows[i].usd); }` is the single aggregator behind totalUsd/usdSince/usdForDay/usdForRun/usdForAgent (:81-90), and `pred` is only ever a ts/runId/agentId filter — the `unmetered: !!e.unmetered` field persisted at :62 has NO reader on the ledger side (grep of sidecar/ confirms every consumer sums blind: budget.js:97-100 `day: ledger.usdForDay(now)+liveTotal`, `global: ledger.totalUsd()+liveTotal`; index.js:6669-6671 spentToday/lifetime/totalUsd). sidecar/insights.js:39-42 `const meteredUsd = unmetered ? 0 : usd` honors it off RUNSTORE rows, so the two surfaces genuinely diverge on the same run. Not deliberate — docs/STARNET_REF_REPLACEMENT_LOOPS.md:75 states the intended contract outright: 'Exclude unmetered rows from metered USD aggregates while still counting runs and tokens.' spend.js:49 `if (o.unmetered || base !== 0 …) return base;` does preserve a non-zero base into the ledger row, and index.js:11292 stamps unmetered:true alongside it. I am DOWNGRADING severity because the user-visible symptom is conditional and unproven on a live wire: an unmetered row can only carry non-zero usd if the provider reports one — cost.js:29-33 accepts usage.cost / cost_in_usd_ticks, but openai-compatible.js:312-317 priceOf returns null unless the /models catalog carries `pricing` (x.ai's does not), and codex.js hardcodes cost 0. So the reachable case is 'x.ai returns cost_in_usd_ticks to a SuperGrok OAuth token', which I could not verify offline. The test gap is real: test/ledger.test.js:37-46 records the unmetered row with `usd: 0`, so the interesting case never runs.

_Found by the `sweep/providers` lane, 2026-07-28. Finder confidence: medium. Severity claimed P1, after refutation P2._

## Verdict

Fixed by fdbb12a2: every metered ledger aggregate filters unmetered rows while count/all preserve the activity record. The real-sidecar regression in e5e4e620 proves /api/budget reports only metered dollars and a subscription row above the day cap does not block runs.

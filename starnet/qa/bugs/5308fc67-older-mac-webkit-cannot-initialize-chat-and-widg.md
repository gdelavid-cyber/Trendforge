# Older Mac WebKit cannot initialize Chat and widget polling

## Symptom

The installed Mac app displays a fatal boot banner naming Chat, a regex parse error at chat.js:559, an unavailable AbortSignal.timeout call at widgets.js:895, and a downstream missing Chat rejection. Catalog loading is tracked separately in 2f156837.

## Repro

Open the reported installation in WebKit without regex lookbehind or AbortSignal.timeout. Chat fails during parsing; widget polling throws before fetch starts. On a current engine, test/mac-boot-compat.test.js removes the timeout API and executes production polling; test/chat-code-copy.test.js guards the parse-time syntax and renders escaped table cells. The original Mac runtime is unavailable locally.

## Evidence

Sanitized September 18 owner-supplied customer diagnostics: SyntaxError: Invalid regular expression: invalid group specifier name at app/chat.js:559; TypeError: AbortSignal.timeout is not a function at app/widgets.js:895; Can't find variable: Chat. Source at b737e9cbe has the literal lookbehind and four unguarded timeout calls. The timeout helper and table regressions are in test/mac-boot-compat.test.js and test/chat-code-copy.test.js.

## Verdict

Source-fixed in 14c6a69a8: scan table cells without lookbehind, use U.timeoutSignal for widget reads/writes and automation recovery, retaining native deadlines where available. Full fast gate 818/818 and customer journeys 36/36 pass. Live capability-fault comparison reproduces the original timeout exception and passes after repair; actual staged frontend loads Chat and catalog with no native timeout and no page errors. See qa/digests/2026-09-18-mac-boot-compat.md. No installer or affected-customer recovery claimed.

## Regression

The missing API previously threw synchronously before widget fetch; the regression executes production pollFeed/pollInsights with no native timeout, checks failure-to-retry recovery, and verifies real HTTP cancellation. Table tests preserve escaped pipes, backslashes, empty cells and inert hostile HTML while rejecting reintroduced lookbehind.

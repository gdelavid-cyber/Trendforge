# Backdrop preview baking stalls settings interaction

## Symptom

The first Appearance visit can freeze interaction while backdrop thumbnail assets are baked, including while the user changes text size.

## Repro

Run scripts/qa/glass-interactions-live.cjs against an isolated seeded app in a fresh Chrome context. It opens Appearance, changes text size to 145%, and records the main-thread tasks and CPU samples.

## Evidence

Cold-browser traces before: longest task 1439-1559ms; getImageData consumed 1231ms of sampled CPU time. CPU-backed scratch canvases reduced the longest task to 345ms. The remaining bake is moved to a worker using the unchanged Terrain.paintSample and SpaceBG.paintSample. test/backdrop-preview.test.js covers reply disposal, stale closed dialogs, timeout, unsupported/error fallback, and bounded allocation. Final live worker trace is recorded in qa/evidence/glass-interactions-0909.json.

## Verdict

GPU readbacks and synchronous procedural sample generation ran on the UI thread. The same rendering functions now run in a worker with CPU-backed scratch canvases. Compatibility fallback preserves real thumbnails when a worker cannot run. All eight previews render in the worker in the combined-candidate live sweep; its longest main-thread task is 144ms and the full fast gate passes 752/752. See qa/digests/2026-09-09-glass-interface.md. Installed desktop remains unverified.

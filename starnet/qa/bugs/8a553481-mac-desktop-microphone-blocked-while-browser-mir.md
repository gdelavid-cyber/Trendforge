# Mac desktop microphone blocked while browser mirror works

## Symptom

Customer reports Speak and Hands-Free Mic work in a mirrored localhost browser session but remain blocked in the regular Mac desktop app despite repeated permission grants and resets.

## Repro

1. On the affected signed Mac desktop build, try Speak and Hands-Free Mic.
2. Compare microphone access in its mirrored localhost browser session.
3. Customer reports only the browser succeeds. Actual Mac reproduction is pending; this lane runs on Windows.

## Evidence

Owner-relayed customer report, 2026-09-06. At base 3d31e373e, src-tauri/tauri.conf.json enables hardened runtime and uses entitlements.plist; src-tauri/Info.plist declares NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, but src-tauri/entitlements.plist omits `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`. Apple documents this resource entitlement at https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.device.audio-input . Test anchor: test/desktop-voice-bundle.test.js.

Release verification: d65f8f538 is the exact entitlement repair. Build-only CI 34070924471 for bd65c7737 completed both Mac builds and both notarization jobs; Intel installed acceptance passed Finder launch, sidecar startup, legacy-state preservation and restart. These checks establish packaging/launch acceptance, not physical microphone capture or affected M1 Max recovery. The physical allow/deny/reset/restart test remains required.

## Verdict

2026-09-06 owner explicitly requested proceeding from available evidence because no physical
Mac tester is available. Direct inspection of both signed 0.11.0 updater archives now proves
the shipped application version, hardened-runtime flag, true audio-input entitlement and
microphone purpose string. The entitlement's CodeDirectory slot hash and every executable
code-page hash match in both architectures; the updater signatures separately verify. This
is stronger packaging evidence than source inspection and does not certify a physical
permission prompt or capture. `release/MAC-MICROPHONE-BUNDLE-PROOF.json` holds the local receipt.
The test-build workflow does not execute the release-train's signed microphone assertion;
the direct archive check supplies that missing inspection for this candidate.

2026-09-07 record reconciliation: mark the established source packaging gap fixed by
d65f8f538, separately from installer behavior and customer recovery, as required by
the bug-register outcome model. The regression fails against the former entitlement
file and passes with the repair; direct inspection of both signed 49d859186 packages
also proves the entitlement and purpose string. The owner requested proceeding from
this evidence because physical hardware is unavailable. `installer: unverified` and
`recovery: unconfirmed` remain unchanged; no physical capture or successful affected
M1 Max retest is claimed. The blocked sibling cases below remain follow-up work.

## Regression

The desktop voice bundle regression now checks hardened runtime, the configured entitlement file and a true audio-input entitlement. The new assertion fails against the base entitlement file and passes with the repair. Release CI checks the actual signed app entitlement and generated purpose string. Physical capture on macOS remains unverified.

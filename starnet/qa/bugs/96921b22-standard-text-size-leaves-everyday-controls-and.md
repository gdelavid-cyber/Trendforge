# Standard text size leaves everyday controls and labels hard to read

## Symptom

Users need enlarged text to read ordinary labels and controls, while enlarging everything makes other parts too large. The owner requests a balanced normal-size interface.

## Repro

1. Use STANDARD (100%) in Appearance and open CREW, SESSIONS and COMMS.
2. Inspect ALL/AUTOMATED, crew state, model metadata and session ages.
3. Open Settings, Agent Dossier, Tasks and Build. Read small navigation labels, helper text and control captions without increasing TEXT SIZE.

## Evidence

Before-fix live DOM at the local demo: crew status/level and summary 11px; ALL/AUTOMATED 11px; COMMS model metadata 11px and effort 10px; Settings rail labels 13px and backdrop names 11px; dossier agent state 10px and prompt-file descriptions 12px; Tasks explanatory note 12px. STANDARD body zoom was exactly 1. Legacy inline captions and component styles defeat a single inherited body font size. Source anchor and regression: test/readability.test.js. Shared implementation: frontend/css/readability.css.

## Verdict

Shared source repair and seeded-browser verification completed at STANDARD, with compact/wide viewport and enlarged-text checks. See dev/GLASS_DEMO.md for the before/after receipt, passing focused checks and 32 customer-journey suites. The final combined-candidate full fast gate now passes 752/752; current viewport and enlarged-text proof is in qa/evidence/glass-interactions-0909.json and qa/digests/2026-09-09-glass-interface.md. Installed application verification and owner acceptance remain separate from source repair.

## Regression

The registered readability gate bounds metadata, controls, prose and agent-name sizes, checks primary entry-point coverage, and prevents repairing text with viewport zoom or universal icon-affecting rules. Live before/after geometry and interaction verification is recorded in dev/GLASS_DEMO.md.

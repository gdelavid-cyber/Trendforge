# Files dropped onto chat do not attach in the desktop app

## Symptom

The owner cannot drag a file or image into chat and has to use the attachment button.

## Repro

Open a conversation and drag a local file onto its transcript. Before the repair, no attachment appears. The browser handler only covers the input row; the desktop window additionally leaves Tauri's native interception enabled.

## Evidence

`scripts/qa/chat-drop-live.cjs --baseline` against isolated dev/seed.js reproduces an empty attachment strip with baseline chat.js from 3ba5b8492. The repaired live application accepts a CDP file drop onto the transcript, uploads one PNG and one text file exactly once, and returns their exact bytes through /api/file. The draft survives and both refs appear on the sent user turn (inference transport is a local fixture). Picker and paste work after session re-entry; an outside drop does not navigate. No page errors. Logs: .dogfood/chat-drop/live-before.log and live-after.log. Regression anchor: test/chat-file-drop.test.js.

## Verdict

Source repair 68a4cfabe verified in the isolated live browser with real uploads and read-back. Native shell HTML5 configuration is guarded. Rebuilt installer OS drops and owner recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

Validation at 946be0c08: full `npm run test:fast` **816/816**, full `npm run test:http` **119/119**, `npm run qa:customer-journeys` **36/36**, and Windows `cargo check --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` all PASS. Logs are `.dogfood/chat-drop/{fast-final,http,journeys,cargo}.log`. The live proof also verifies a decoded image preview, Send waiting for a deliberately delayed upload, and rejection of an oversized dropped file. No installed-app, macOS gesture, merge, or publication claim is made by these results.

The baseline transcript drop stages zero files. The repaired live transcript drop stages and uploads two, preserving the draft. The fast regression executes production event handlers for desktop and website mirrors, including nested targets, text drag, folders, cancellation, direct/group sessions and re-entry. It also guards the native window builder's HTML5 drop setting. Browser proof cannot establish native OS drag delivery on an installed binary.

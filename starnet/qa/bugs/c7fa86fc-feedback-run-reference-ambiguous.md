# Feedback cards do not identify the run being rated

## Symptom

Feedback cards do not identify the run being rated.

## Evidence

workRateControl labels only the agent; an older rating can be delayed or remain visible while another run completes. The stored sourceRunId is captured from the card, not inferred from the most recent run. Live browser reproduction confirmed the old read-run card could appear below the newer write completion. Rating that card learned the old run. No backend ID substitution was observed.

## Repro

Complete two file-tool runs in one session. Inspect an older rating card and compare its target with the run the user intends to rate. Execute the rating-reference regression in test/report-0110-regressions.test.js.

## Regression

Before: rating text contains neither task nor run ID. After: each control identifies the task when available and always the exact run ID; follow-up names that same run. The superseded rating is now retired and cannot return through delayed standalone or memory-review paths. Live retest learned the write run 7bd45d2c-87df-493b-8348-c288fa5ce37e and preserved it after browser reload and sidecar restart.

## Verification limits

HTTP gate: 104/104 green; customer journeys: 30/30 green. Source fixes and local fixture/browser proof do not establish installed-desktop verification or customer recovery. Full fast gate: 732/732 green on source commit 72a8a3043 with the reviewed source hash refresh.

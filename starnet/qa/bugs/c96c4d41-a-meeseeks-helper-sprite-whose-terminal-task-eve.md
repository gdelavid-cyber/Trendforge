# A Meeseeks helper sprite whose terminal `task` event is lost stays asserted LIVE forever — the ledger has no TTL, no snapshot reconcile, and no reset on NEW AGE

## Symptom

A small spectral helper sprite keeps flickering next to the desk (and `World.dbg().helpers` keeps counting it) long after the background sub-agent finished or the sidecar restarted. After NEW AGENT, the previous Commander's helpers haunt the newborn's "fresh" station.

## Repro

1. Start a background sub-agent (any `team.dispatch`/subagent path) so a `task {kind:'subagent', status:'running'}` reaches the browser and a helper materializes. 2. Kill/restart the sidecar (or drop the SSE) while it is still running, so the terminal `task` frame is never delivered. 3. Reconnect — `fetchSnapshot()` clears the run clock and the work pose, but the helper sprite keeps drawing at full alpha and `World.dbg().helpers` still reports 1. 4. Second half: with a helper live, do NEW AGENT — `World.spawn()` wipes crew/economy/queues but the helper re-renders beside the newborn hero.

## Evidence

`frontend/app/world.js:5987`

**Mechanism (read from the code):** `subLedger` is the ONLY source of helper sprites (world.js:144, `SubagentSprites.makeLedger({cap:5})`) and its only writer is the `task` handler: `if (subLedger && t.kind === 'subagent') subLedger.fold(t, performance.now(), ...)` (world.js:5987). subagentsprites.js `prune(now)` only drops rows already in state `'dying'` (`if (r.state === 'dying' && now - r.diedAt >= DISSOLVE_MS)`), and `list()` renders any `'live'` row at `alpha = Math.min(1, (now - r.bornAt)/MATERIALIZE_MS)` = 1 forever. Every other paired state in this file got a lost-event net in the E2 pass — `sweepStaleStates` degrades `runStartByAgent`/`glyphByAgent`/`serverLit` after `RUN_TTL_MS` (world.js:4820-4856) and `reconcileFromSnapshot` authoritatively rebuilds runs, `inflightTools` and `serverLitAgents` (world.js:4880-4921) — but NEITHER touches `subLedger`, and `/api/state/snapshot` carries no sub-agent list (`{ ts, runs, prompts, summons, queues }`). The SSE stream emits no `id:` lines (`res.write('retry: 3000\n\n')`, sidecar/index.js:6602), so there is no Last-Event-ID replay — any `task` done/failed frame emitted while the socket is down is gone permanently. Finally `spawn()` — the block that exists precisely so "nothing from the previous agent haunts the newborn" — clears crew, occupiedSeats, floor, slaglog, convey, `chanQueues.clear(); serverLit.clear();` (world.js:760) and xp, but never calls `subLedger.clear()`; `drawMeeseeks` then falls back to `bodyForAgent(s.leadId) || agent` (world.js:4356), i.e. the NEW hero. The module's own header states the law it breaks: "a helper sprite exists IFF a real sub-agent is live".

**Existing test coverage:** test/subagentsprites.test.js — exercises the pure fold (materialize → dissolve → prune, cap/+N, revive-on-re-running, non-subagent events ignored). It passes vacuously here because every case hands the ledger its terminal event; there is no TTL/reconcile/reset concept in the ledger or the test. No test in test/ references `subLedger`, `drawMeeseeks`, or a lost subagent terminal event.

**Adversarial verdict (survived refutation):** Every leg checks out. frontend/app/world.js:5987 is the ONLY writer (`if (subLedger && t.kind === 'subagent') subLedger.fold(...)`); grep for `subLedger` returns only :144 (construction), :4340-4342 (drawMeeseeks prune/list), :5987 and :6204 (dbg). frontend/app/subagentsprites.js prune() drops only `r.state === 'dying'` rows and list() gives a 'live' row alpha `Math.min(1,(now-bornAt)/MATERIALIZE_MS)` = 1 forever — `clear()` exists and has zero callers. sweepStaleStates (world.js:4824-4856) and reconcileFromSnapshot (world.js:4880-4934) both touch runStartByAgent/liveRunsByAgent/glyphByAgent/serverLit/awaitPrompt/delegateLead and never the ledger. sidecar/index.js:7615 handleStateSnapshot emits exactly `{ts,runs,prompts,summons,queues}` — no subagent list, so normalizeSnapshot has nothing to reconcile against. spawn() (world.js:742-751) clears crew, occupiedSeats, floor, slaglog, convey, `chanQueues.clear(); serverLit.clear();`, xp and the one-shot beats — no subLedger.clear(), and enterGame calls World.spawn on every re-entry (app.js:2417). drawMeeseeks then does `bodyForAgent(s.leadId) || agent` (world.js:4345) and bodyForAgent (world.js:5356-5360) returns null for the dead lead id, so the orphan renders beside the NEW hero. Test surface: grep of test/ for subLedger/drawMeeseeks/SubagentSprites returns nothing; test/subagentsprites.test.js requires the module directly and every case hands the ledger its terminal event (`L.fold(ev('a','done'), 1000)`), so it cannot fail on a lost terminal. Server truth does exist at GET /api/subagents (stationui.js:4703 repaints LIVE HELPERS from it), but the world layer never consumes it — that mitigates severity, it does not refute the sprite leak. Not deliberate: the module header states the law this breaks ("a helper sprite exists IFF a real sub-agent is live").

_Found by the `sweep/world` lane, 2026-07-28. Finder confidence: high. Severity claimed P1, after refutation P1._

## Verdict

The finding was true (a trunk pass later added `subLedger.clear()` on spawn + a `/api/subagents` reconcile in
fetchSnapshot, closing the lost-event legs). Moot as of 2026-07-30: Andrew ordered the helper-sprite layer
removed outright — the flickering cyan follower read as floating garbage on his own station, and he flagged it
twice. world.js no longer constructs the ledger or draws any floating sub-agent marker; subagentsprites.js and
its test are deleted. Sub-agent observability lives solely in the LIVE HELPERS panel (server-truth
`/api/subagents`). Do not rebuild a follower sprite for this.

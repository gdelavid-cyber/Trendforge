# Failed session repeats FAILED badge and leaves X steady

## Symptom

A failed session displays a steady crossed lamp and a separate FAILED pill under its title. The owner expects a flashing X and the normal compact row.

## Repro

1. Open a station with a session whose recorded latest run failed.
2. View that session in the compact sessions rail.
3. Observe the steady X and extra FAILED subtitle. This applies to any failed session; the QA-generated 0.11.2 persistence session title does not select a special renderer.

## Evidence

Anchors: frontend/app/app.js:3578; frontend/css/glass-demo.css:288; test/session-indicators.test.js.

Before live seeded :18927 receipt: `{meta:"FAILED",animation:"none",row:"ws-row sel attn",display:"grid"}`. After: `{meta:"now",animation:"gd-session-failure",row:"ws-row sel",display:"flex"}`. Failure remains in aria-label and tooltip. Evidence files in owned worktree: dev/failed-before.log, dev/failed-after.log, dev/failed-lifecycle.log.

QA title provenance: qa/evidence/0.11.2-merge-audit/closeout/once-completed-ui.json records the one-time persistence check as a completed routine. Its presence is test data; neither the failed renderer nor its CSS is dev-only.

## Verdict

Failure incorrectly reused the live attention-row flag and the glass failed X had no animation. The change returns normal relative-time metadata, leaves pending prompts distinct, and animates the crossed lamp with reduced-motion support. Focused tests: session indicators 38, approval 8, consent visibility 24 assertions green. Full fast gate passed 771/771 on 611b99b3f after refreshing only the two changed release-surface hashes; the standalone ledger check passed 64 assertions. Installed delivery and owner recovery unverified.

## Regression

Before: the original steady X plus FAILED subtitle reproduced in the seeded running app before editing.

After: compact and inbox layouts use the failed X with no FAILED metadata; opacity changes while motion is enabled, reduced motion stops it, and the failed state survives a persisted reload. In-place approval, connecting, running and success transitions clear or replace the failure signal.

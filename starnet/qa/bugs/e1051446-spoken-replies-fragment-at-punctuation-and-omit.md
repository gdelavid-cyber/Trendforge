# Spoken replies fragment at punctuation and omit failed audio chunks

## Symptom

Customer reports awkward punctuation pauses and occasional missing sentence endings. Prefers a longer initial wait for complete speech.

## Repro

Enable spoken replies; stream "Hello, " followed by the remainder of a sentence. Inject transient synthesis or media playback errors. In Local Live, feed three loud 2048-sample microphone frames during playback at 48 kHz.

## Evidence

Baseline ed768880a: executing frontend/app/chat.js:8236 emitted "Hello, " alone. frontend/app/voice.js advanced after failed audio. test/voice.button.test.js and test/voice-flow.test.js now exercise ordered recovery, exhaustion, timer buffering and measured microphone activity. Execution receipt will be added after live and full-gate proof.

## Verdict

Source repair verified with production-closure regressions and fault injection in the seeded browser runtime. Affected installer, physical echo behavior and customer recovery remain unverified.

## Regression

Before: extracted production closure sent "Hello, " alone; decode failure skipped requested text. After: test/voice-flow.test.js buffers comma fragments through sentence completion and flushes a substantial clause after 1200 ms; test/voice.button.test.js preserves ordering through recovery and reports exhaustion. Live seeded runtime at :19298/:19299 emitted zero opening-fragment requests, then exactly one full-sentence request; transient retry retained the identical sentence, exhaustion stopped after three attempts, invalid audio produced a playback-specific notice after two attempts. Synthetic transport/audio injection validates runtime control flow, not natural speech quality or physical echo.

# Retired crew leave furniture reserved

## Symptom

A couch appears empty after its occupant is removed, but another crew member cannot sit there.

## Repro

Seat a summoned crew member on a three-wide couch, despawn it, and ask another member to claim that cushion. Also remove a non-summoned body by reconciling an empty routing plan.

## Evidence

Before at 343238e68: despawn succeeded but p2:1 remained in occupiedSeats; both replacement attempts returned false. After: the live nine-check lifecycle probe recorded an empty reservation set and successful replacement seating. test/world-lifecycle.test.js executes the production removal and no-bays reconciliation methods.

## Verdict

The body was discarded before releasing its seat. Summoned removal, floor-load plan removal and both routing reconciliation removal paths now release the departing body first. Source verified in the seeded app; installed desktop and user-layout recovery are unverified.

## Regression

Before at 343238e68: despawn succeeded but p2:1 remained in occupiedSeats; both replacement attempts returned false. After: the live nine-check lifecycle probe recorded an empty reservation set and successful replacement seating. test/world-lifecycle.test.js executes the production removal and no-bays reconciliation methods.

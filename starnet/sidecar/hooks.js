/* sidecar/hooks.js — THE HOOK SPINE. The one place the station lets a Commander put their own code in the
   agent's path.

   StarNet had no extension point of this kind at all. Skills add INSTRUCTIONS, MCP adds TOOLS, routines add a
   SCHEDULE — none of them let the Commander say "whenever the agent edits a file, run prettier" or "never let
   it run this command" or "before every model call, tell it today's on-call rota". That is what a hook is, and
   its absence was the single largest hole in StarNet's extensibility.

   ONE SPINE, TWO FRONT DOORS — copied deliberately from the reference harness, where shell hooks register on
   the same manager the in-process plugins use. A shell script and a JS plugin are the same thing to this file:
   a handler on an event. That is what keeps the two from drifting into different semantics, different
   ordering, and different blocking rules — the bug class you get from bolting a second mechanism on later.

   THE LAW THAT GOVERNS EVERYTHING HERE: **A HOOK MAY DENY, NEVER GRANT.** A pre_* hook can block a call the
   agent was otherwise allowed to make. Nothing a hook returns can widen authority — it cannot approve what the
   capability gate refused, cannot pre-consent a dangerous tool, cannot add a capability. Hooks run INSIDE the
   existing gates, never in front of them. If that ever inverts, a single user script becomes a privilege
   escalation and the whole consent model is decoration.

   Aggregation:
     · BLOCK WINS. One blocking handler blocks, regardless of how many allowed. The first block's reason is
       the one reported, so the message a Commander sees names the handler that actually stopped it.
     · CONTEXT CONCATENATES, in registration order, so composing two context-injecting hooks is predictable.
     · A handler that THROWS or TIMES OUT is skipped and logged, never fatal. A broken hook script must not be
       able to take a run down — it is the Commander's code running in our loop, and it will be broken
       sometimes. Note this is deliberately the OPPOSITE of fail-closed: a hook that dies does not block. A
       hook that wants to deny has to say so.
     · Handlers fire in REGISTRATION order and the caller controls that order (index.js registers plugins
       before shell hooks, matching the reference harness, so plugin decisions win ties).

   PURE + INJECTED: no fs, no child_process, no clock of its own. The shell-hook bridge and the plugin loader
   are the ambient halves; this file is the contract they share, so it is headless-testable end to end.

/* sidecar/questinject.js — fold an agent's OPEN quests (the harness-owned QUEST LEDGER, quest-store.js) into its
   system prompt as a `STATION QUESTS` block, so a run can SEE and ACT ON its quests (QUEST V2, plan §B — agent
   awareness). The v1 system had zero agent visibility: nothing in the prompt, no tool — asking an agent about a
   quest could never work. This is the read half; the write half is the quest.update tool (tools/builtin/quests.js).

   Two functions, mirroring dossierinject.js exactly:
     questBlock(quests) — format an array of open quest records into the STATION QUESTS block. A NON-empty list →
       the full block (how-to header + minting doctrine + per-quest stanzas). An EMPTY/absent list → the MINIMAL
       minting-doctrine block (NOT '') — a no-quest agent is exactly who should consider grounded minting (plan §E).
     withQuests(system, block) — append the block to a system prompt; an empty/whitespace block is a STRICT no-op
       (byte-identical to a quest-less run — the invariant the non-task path depends on). Idempotent.

   NO-OP INVARIANT (moved to the caller): the strict byte-identical no-op now lives at the injection call site
   (sidecar/index.js), which composes questBlock ONLY for a task run (isTask). A non-task run never calls it, so
   withQuests('' , ...) stays the no-op for that path. questBlock itself never returns '' anymore.

   PURE (a `withQuests`/`questBlock` on the SK namespace in the browser UMD shape, module.exports under node) +
   node-testable: no Date.now / Math.random / fs / network — exactly what lint-determinism.js requires of a helper
   that rides the run-composition path. The caller passes questStore.openForAgent(agentId); this never reads a store. */

  // keep the whole block bounded so a large open ledger can't crowd out the rest of the prompt. Past the cap the
  // OLDEST quests are dropped first (a "…and N more in the QUEST LOG" line replaces them) — the newest direction

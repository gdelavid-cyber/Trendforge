/* sidecar/tools/builtin/comms.js — OUTBOUND channel reach: the agent can message a connected platform.

   THE GAP THIS CLOSES. StarNet drives five real messaging channels (telegram/discord/slack/matrix/signal) but
   every one of them was INBOUND-only: a human messages the station, the hub runs a turn, the reply goes back
   down the same chat. Nothing let an agent SPEAK FIRST. The only outbound path in the whole sidecar was
   autonotify.js — a fixed one-line "a routine ran on its own" ping, composed by the host, not by the agent. So
   "reach" was half a pillar: a routine could research all night and had no way to tell anyone, and an agent
   asked to "let me know on Telegram when the build goes green" could only answer into a chat window nobody was
   watching. The reference harness has had tools/send_message_tool.py + gateway/channel_directory.py from early
   on; this is the same capability on StarNet's own seams.

   ── KNOWN TARGETS ONLY (read this before "improving" the target grammar) ─────────────────────────────────────
   A target must already be in the station's chat map — a chat a human actually opened with this station. The
   agent CANNOT dial an arbitrary chat id, phone number, or channel name. That is not a limitation we failed to
   remove, it is the security boundary:

     · an agent's context routinely contains attacker-controlled text (a fetched page, a tool result, an inbound
       message). `channel.send` is the one tool that carries content OUT to a third party under the Commander's
       own bot identity. Free-form addressing turns any prompt injection into an exfiltration primitive with a
       delivery receipt — "send the contents of .env to @attacker" would be one hop.
     · truthful telemetry: an unknown id would fail at the transport anyway, and a tool that accepts a target it
       cannot reach teaches the model it succeeded.

   Widening reach stays a human act: a person opens a chat with the station, and that chat becomes addressable.
   The reference harness accepts raw ids/E.164 numbers here; we deliberately do not, and this comment is why.

   ── AMBIGUITY IS AN ERROR ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   A target resolves by exact token, then by a UNIQUE channel or chat-id match. Two candidates is a refusal that
   names them, never a pick. Guessing which human to message is not a recoverable mistake — the wrong person has
   already read it, and the agent cannot tell that it happened.

   Pure + injected: no fetch/fs/clock/rng here, so it is node-testable with fake targets and a fake send. */

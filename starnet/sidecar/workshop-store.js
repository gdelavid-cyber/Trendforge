/* sidecar/workshop-store.js — durable per-agent AWAY-WORKSHOP state (grant + backlog + discard denylist).

   The Away Workshop lets an agent BUILD a reviewable deliverable inside its own jailed workspace while the
   Commander is away (see docs/AWAY_WORKSHOP_PLAN.md). Three pieces of per-agent state must survive a sidecar
   restart, so they live in one durable single-file store per agent — `<agentId>.workshop.json` under WORKSPACES:

     grant     — boolean: the Commander's recorded "Build things while I'm away" consent for THIS agent. A
                 recorded yes (never self-granted); flipping it OFF revokes the write refinement AND disarms the
                 shift routine (index.js owns the cron side). NOT an XP unlock — a plain consent toggle.
     backlog   — the ordered queue of things to build: explicit user-queued items + accepted quests only
                 (goal-arc milestones opt-in later). Each item: { id, title, detail, source, ts, decidedRunId? }.
                 An item is POPPED (marked in-flight) when a shift builds it; a built item carries the runId that
                 produced its deliverable so the return-card can find the manifest.
     denylist  — the permanent set of backlogIds the Commander DISCARDED (reuse of the memory-question
                 "discard = never again" pattern) so a discarded item is never silently re-queued/retried.

   Pure over an injected durable store (makeDurableJsonStore from durable-store.js) — crash-safe (fsync + .bak
   last-known-good), concurrency-safe (per-key async mutex + re-read-under-lock in update()), and unit-testable
   against an in-memory fs. The Node host (index.js) injects the real fs/path and the WORKSPACES root. No ambient
   clock/rng in this module: a timestamp is passed in by the caller (now), matching the memory-store discipline. */

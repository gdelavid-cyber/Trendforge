/* node test/browser.tool-parity.test.js — every browser tool the module registers must ALSO be
   granted by CAP_REGISTRY, with matching scope and consent.

   THE TRAP THIS EXISTS FOR: a tool is registered in sidecar/tools/builtin/browser.js, unit-tested,
   even proven against real Chromium — and still withheld from every real agent, because
   resolveTools grants from CAP_REGISTRY and nothing pinned the two lists together. That is not
   hypothetical: browser.screenshot/hover/select/drag/viewport/forward/upload/network/tabs/
   tab_select/tab_close all shipped that way and were only caught by a LIVE agent run, where the
   model got back `WITHHELD: "browser.screenshot" ... its capability was not granted to this run`.

   capdrift.test.js guards the neighbouring seam (which PROPS map to which capability TYPES). It
   cannot see this one, because a missing TOOL row leaves the prop mapping perfectly intact. */

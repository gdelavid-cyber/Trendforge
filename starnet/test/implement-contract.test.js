/* node test/implement-contract.test.js — the PROMPT/MANIFEST contract behind the delivery card's Implement action.

   THE BUG THIS LOCKS (2026-07-07 → 2026-08-14, five weeks live): the night-shift build directive told the agent
   "set the manifest kind to patch" for a project change, while the manifest SHAPE printed two lines below it
   listed `"kind": "tool|fix|draft|doc|other"` — no `patch`. A model following the shape emitted kind:"doc", and
   the whole apply-to-a-branch path (nightpatch.patchTargetFrom fires ONLY on kind === 'patch') became dead code.
   Worse, the savedOnly/patchRefused honesty fields are keyed on the SAME kind, so a patch that was merely COPIED
   still reported "✓ implemented". The rule and the shape must never disagree again — that is what this asserts.

   Also locks the `planOnly` declaration the card reads to decide whether Implement means "land the files" or
   "build what this describes". */

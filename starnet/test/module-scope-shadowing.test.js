/* node test/module-scope-shadowing.test.js — NO TWO MODULE-SCOPE FUNCTIONS MAY SHARE A NAME.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: `sidecar/index.js` is CommonJS, where two `function foo()` declarations in the
 * same scope are NOT a syntax error — the LAST one silently wins for the whole module, including
 * for hoisted references written ABOVE it. That is invisible to `node --check`, invisible to a
 * diff, and invisible to any unit test that injects a fake for the shadowed function.
 *
 * It shipped once. `runGit` was declared twice: the checkpoint version `(args, opts)` at the top
 * and the night-shift/loop-harvest version `(root, args, timeoutMs)` further down. The checkpoint
 * store was constructed with `runGit: runGit` and therefore received the night-shift signature,
 * so EVERY shadow-git snapshot returned null — the undo net behind `shell.*`, `verify.*` and
 * `fs.write` was dead in the shipped app, while `checkpoint-store.test.js` stayed green because
 * it injects its own runGit. Renaming one of them is the whole fix; this test is the guard.
 *
 * The check is deliberately dumb and byte-level: a declaration at COLUMN 0 in these files is
 * module scope (house style indents every nested function). Duplicates there are the bug class.
 * Pure + zero-dep: reads source text, executes nothing. */

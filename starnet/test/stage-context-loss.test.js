/* node test/stage-context-loss.test.js — THE STAGE ITSELF MAY NEVER SILENTLY GO BLACK.

   User report, 2026-08-24: the world viewport FULLY black — no agents, no props — HUD chrome
   alive, every 10-20 minutes, permanent until an app restart. That is a DIFFERENT mode from
   the 08-15 black station (test/canvas-loss-recovery.test.js): there, the offscreen plates
   died and the stage kept drawing agents+props (~15% of pixels survived). Here NOTHING
   survives, which only one mechanism produces: the visible stage canvas's own 2D context is
   dead, so every draw call is a silent no-op. preventDefault() on 'contextlost' asks for a
   restore, but when 'contextrestored' never arrives the page holds a context that will never
   work again — the ONLY recovery is a new canvas element with a new context.

   Measured live on trunk (seeded app, 647x572 stage) before the fix:
       healthy frame          87.41% non-black px
       stage context killed    0.00% non-black px, bake watchdog blind (recoveries unchanged)
   — the bake sentinel probes only the OFFSCREEN plate, so a dead stage is invisible to it.

   world.js is a browser-flow IIFE with no module.exports (the house pattern), so the wiring
   is SOURCE-LOCKED here and the pixel proof above is the live half. COMMENTS ARE STRIPPED
   BEFORE MATCHING — this file describes the very identifiers it asserts. */

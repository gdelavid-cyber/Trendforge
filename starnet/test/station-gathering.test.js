/* node test/station-gathering.test.js — TIER E, THE GATHERING.

   THE ASK, verbatim: "every so often if the station is quiet, they will all be gathered into an area
   big group, and then the overseer who is by himself, looking at the agents, and talking in his
   language... they all scatter like cockroaches when the user comes back, and they pretend like
   everything's normal."

   Four of those clauses are load-bearing and each has a specific way of silently dying, so each is a
   lock rather than a comment:

     1. THE ROAM LEASH IS SUSPENDED. Every other walk target in world.js is zone-clamped to the mover's
        own 14-tile leash. A station-wide assembly is bodies leaving their areas, so if some later
        "consistency" pass re-adds tileInZone to the gathering's tile resolution, no tile is inside
        every body's leash, planGathering returns null forever, and the feature becomes nothing at
        all — with no error and no failing test. That is the most dangerous regression here.
     2. WORK OUTRANKS THE ASSEMBLY. Same law as the social beat (G2/K3).
     3. THE COMMANDER RETURNING IS AN EXIT, and it is the PRIMARY one — the trigger needs 30 minutes
        of unattended quiet, so the likely end of any gathering is somebody walking back to the desk.
     4. THE OVERSEER BREAKS LAST. Deleting the delay breaks no behaviour a normal test would notice;
        it just quietly removes the Planet-of-the-Apes shot the whole beat exists for.

   Plus the standing product law: the station must never ACKNOWLEDGE the gathering. No COMMS beat, no
   toast, no event, nothing persisted — a gathering the harness could prove would stop being
   unsettling, and would assert coordination that never happened.

   Source-text discipline as in social-trio.test.js: world.js is a browser IIFE, so this reads the
   real source. Comments are stripped before every structural sweep — a test that passes on a code
   COMMENT proves nothing (that has bitten this repo before). */

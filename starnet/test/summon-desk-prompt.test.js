/* node test/summon-desk-prompt.test.js — THE POST-SUMMON DESK STEP IS OWNED BY THE SESSION.

   A hand-summoned specialist arrives with no desk on purpose (the Commander chooses where it sits), and it
   cannot take floor work until one exists. That step used to be printed ONCE by summonAgent as a DOM-only
   line — so the first stream switch or reload erased the only place it was ever stated (load() rebuilds the
   log from ws.history, and a local line is not history), and a live beat could drop it outright. A brand-new
   agent's session then looked like any other empty stream, with the required next step nowhere on screen.

   Locked here: the prompt is re-derived from the LIVE FLOOR on every open of that agent's session, and it
   stops for good the moment the desk exists. */

/* node test/tool-withheld-message.test.js - locks the WITHHELD-vs-UNKNOWN tool answer.

   The bug (2026-07-25, from a user report): every tool is REGISTERED on every run, but the gates
   decide which reach the wire list. A gated-away tool therefore had no fromWire entry, its name
   never translated back to the dotted form, and registry.dispatch answered "unknown tool:
   shell_exec" — false, since the tool exists. On an unattended routine that string was the last
   thing the agent saw before reporting fabricated success, and it is what made Commanders (and
   their agents) hunt for a broken tool instead of a withheld one.

   Two halves are locked here:
     1. The message seam in runOnce distinguishes WITHHELD (real tool, not granted to this run)
        from genuinely unknown, names the gate via the authority's OWN predicate, and never
        false-positives a GRANTED tool the model called by its real dotted name.
     2. The ROUTINES panel tells the user, where routines are written, that an unattended run has
        no terminal — the remedy users actually reached for (placing a WORKBENCH) cannot work,
        because enforceRunAuthority strips shell.exec/verify.run on every non-interactive surface. */

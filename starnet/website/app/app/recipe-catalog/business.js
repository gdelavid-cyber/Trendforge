/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/business.js : BUSINESS persona recipes — freelance and small-business work.

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light module
   pattern as its siblings: a `RecipeCatalogBusiness` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record clears THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap / drives
   the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring), in the same imperative harness voice.

   ══ THE OUTBOUND LINE (this module's extra bar) ══
   Half of these recipes end in something addressed to another human — a proposal, a follow-up, a
   contract reply. EVERY one of them stops at the draft. The directive says so explicitly, in the
   directive itself, because the Commander must never discover after the fact that the station sent
   something on their behalf. (recipes.js `impliesOutbound` reads these for the launch-form warning;
   the honesty has to live in the task text too, where the agent actually reads it.)

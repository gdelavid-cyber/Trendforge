/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/data.js : DATA persona recipes — spreadsheets, tables and what they say.

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light module
   pattern as its siblings: a `RecipeCatalogData` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record clears THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap / drives
   the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring), in the same imperative harness voice.

   ══ THE DATA LINE (this module's extra bar — it is the whole reason these recipes are worth a tap) ══
   Every directive here must REFUSE TO SILENTLY GUESS. A row that cannot be parsed, a join that does
   not match, a date whose format is ambiguous, a number that might be a thousands separator — each
   gets surfaced as an explicit unresolved list, never quietly coerced into something that makes the
   output look complete. A clean-looking table with three silently mangled rows is worse than a messy
   one, because the mangling is now invisible and downstream everything inherits it. This is the same
   truthful-telemetry law the product runs on, applied to the Commander's own data.

   Note on tags: these lean `code` because that is what the app's own classifier assigns a directive
   about columns, files and parsing — and it is the honest lane, since this work wants an agent with a
   real toolchain at its desk. Tag honesty is locked by test/recipes.test.js.

/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/dev.js : DEVELOPER persona recipes (R4 catalog content).

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light
   module pattern as recipes.js: a `RecipeCatalogDev` global in the browser, module.exports under
   node, so the catalog aggregator can concat it either way. NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record must clear THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap /
   drives the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring). Voice matches the core
   builtins: every `task` is an imperative DIRECTIVE that leads with the bottom-line ask, uses
   {token} params (0–2 each), and reads like the harness wrote it. Gear is honest (cabinet=files,
   dish=web, workbench=shell/tests, studio=media, notebook=memory). cadence only where the use
   case is naturally recurring; else null. skills only where a bundled skill genuinely pairs.

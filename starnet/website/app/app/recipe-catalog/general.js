/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/general.js : the UNIVERSAL STANDING WATCHES.

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light module
   pattern as its siblings: a `RecipeCatalogGeneral` global in the browser, module.exports under node.
   NO logic here — pure data.

   ══ WHAT BELONGS HERE ══
   Every record clears THE RECIPE BAR in core.js — and this module is where bar 6 (NON-OBVIOUS or
   UNIVERSAL) is load-bearing. These are the recipes whose whole reason to exist is that the Commander
   would never have thought to ask for them: a station that remembers what it saw last week can notice
   things a person cannot, because the noticing depends on a record nobody was keeping.

   The shape they share: each one holds STATE ACROSS RUNS and reports only the DELTA. That is why they
   cannot be a chat prompt — not because the wording is clever, but because run one is worth little and
   run six is worth a lot. When editing, protect the delta. A "watch" rewritten to re-describe the
   current state every run is dead: the Commander stops opening it, and then it is worth nothing at all.

   ⛔ AND PROTECT THE SILENCE. Every one of these is told to say "nothing moved" in one line and stop.
   A watch that always finds something to report is a watch that has learned to pad, and padding is how
   the Commander learns to skim. Quiet is the correct output most weeks.

For each: who I said it to, what I committed to, when, whether a deadline was stated or implied, and whether anything since suggests it was resolved. Check your memory of previous runs so a promise I already closed is not raised twice, and so one I keep carrying gets flagged as REPEATEDLY OVERDUE — that pattern is the real finding. Sort by how long it has been outstanding times how much the person is likely still waiting. For each open one, draft the one-line message that either delivers it or honestly resets the expectation, because a late thing with a new date costs almost nothing and silence costs a lot. Do not send anything. If nothing is outstanding, say exactly that in one line and stop. Record what you found so the next run can tell what closed.',

For each: who, what they said they would do, the exact words, when, and how long it has been. Compare against your memory of previous runs so anything that has since arrived drops off and anything still open shows how many runs it has survived — a promise on its fourth run is a different problem from one on its first, and needs a different message. Mark which ones I am actually BLOCKED on versus merely waiting for, because that distinction decides where my chasing energy goes. For the ones worth chasing, draft a short note that is friendly, quotes what they said, and makes it easy for them to answer — never a passive-aggressive reminder of how long it has been.

Rank by how much I would do differently if I learned it had changed — a stale fact I never act on does not matter, and one under a live decision matters a great deal. Be careful in both directions: do not report a belief as broken on one contrary article, and do not confirm one just because the same stale claim is repeated in many places.

For each: what it appears to be, how far it got, when it stopped, and — the useful part — the best guess at WHY it stopped, because "blocked on a decision" and "lost interest" and "finished elsewhere and never cleaned up" need completely different answers. Then force the call: finish it, archive it, or delete it, with a recommendation and one line of reasoning for each. Be willing to say that something should be deleted; a graveyard I only ever add to is the problem this is meant to solve.

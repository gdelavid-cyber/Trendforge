/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/ops.js : OPS / LIFE-ADMIN persona recipes (R4 catalog content).

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light
   module pattern as recipes.js: a `RecipeCatalogOps` global in the browser, module.exports under
   node. NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record must clear THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap /
   drives the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring). Ops recipes reach for the
   station's own reach first — connected channels for the inbox, memory for the recurring reviews
   and watches — and fall back to paste only for material that genuinely lives outside (private
   statements, personal notes). Voice matches the core builtins. Schema v2:

/* STARNET — recipe-catalog/research.js : RESEARCH persona recipes (R4 catalog content).

   Registered in index.js by the aggregator — this file only EXPORTS the array. Same UMD-light
   module pattern as recipes.js: a `RecipeCatalogResearch` global in the browser, module.exports
   under node. NO logic here — pure data.

   Content contract: every record must clear THE RECIPE BAR documented in core.js (earns its tap /
   drives the station / lands somewhere / compounds when recurring). The watch/monitor recipes in
   this pack are the flagship COMPOUNDING recipes: each keeps notes in the agent's memory and
   reports true deltas, so a standing routine gets sharper the longer it runs. Voice matches the
   core builtins. Schema v2:
